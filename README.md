# That-s-a-Rap-
After the historic Kendrick Lamar and Drake rap beef comes to a close, fans like myself are left wondering the limitless what-ifs. This app was built with the intentions of solving the what-ifs of this specific rap battle, but also opens the door to endless opportunities to explore other possibilities of rappers and their potential verses. Utilizing AI to filter through rapper's previous lyrics and rap styles, new verses are generated following the rapper's unique and individualistic vocal skills. This of course also allows for new verses and music to be produced of deceased rappers like Pop Smoke or Tupac, finishing and/or creating new songs.

There were many firsts with this project. Being a relatively new programmer with little to no experience, the coding portion was a challenge itself. Learning Python on a few day's notice with almost no other languages to build off from made it feel like starting from scratch. Furthermore, the AWS systems including Amazon Bedrock were all new information which added onto the number of unknown items. Eventually that to-do/learn list was overflowing and LaunchDarkly and Canvas were unfortunately unable to be learned and utilized. Overall, starting from basically nothing, I am extremely proud of what was accomplished in this short period of time and the experience I gained.
